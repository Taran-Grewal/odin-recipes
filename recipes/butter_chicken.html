            <li>To prepare this main course dish recipe, wash the chicken pieces under running water and pat them dry with a kitchen cloth. Marinate the chicken pieces in a bowl by mixing together curd, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli powder, tandoori chicken masala, salt (to taste) and leave it for 4-5 hours in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Place a pan over medium flame and heat 1 tablespoon of oil in it. Add the marinated chicken pieces when the oil is hot and cook for 10 minutes. The chicken will become dry, almost crispy.</li>
            <li>Simultaneously, start preparing the gravy by chopping the tomatoes into 4 pieces and adding them in a pan with 1/2 cup of water. Place the pan over medium flame and let the tomatoes get tender. Transfer these in a blender jar and blend the boiled tomatoes into a puree. Strain the mixture in a small bowl for removing lumps and seeds.</li>
            <li>Heat a pan over medium flame and add a dollop of butter in it. When the butter has melted, add ginger-garlic paste, red chilli powder and green chillies in it. Saute these for a while and pour the blended tomato puree in it. Stir it well and let it boil. Add the chicken pieces in it and mix these in. Now, add sugar and salt in it. Put a lid on the pan and cook for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>After a while, remove the lid and sprinkle fenugreek leaves on top to add flavour to your dish. Once the gravy has thickened, transfer the dish in a bowl and garnish with fresh cream and coriander leaves. Serve hot to enjoy!</li>
